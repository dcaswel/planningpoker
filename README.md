# Planning Poker

This is an app that I am building for my dev team to use. Feel free to fork it and use it yourself but I am not actively
supporting it outside of my own needs. The tech stack is Laravel/Inertia/Vue so installing it is the standard install
process for that stack. This does depend on the Echo package so you will need setup an account with Pusher or something 
else that is compatible and set that up.
